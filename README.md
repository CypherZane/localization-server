`LinkoraLocalizationServer` powers [Linkora](https://github.com/sakethpathike/Linkora)'s remote strings, which can be used in the app alongside locally available languages and their respective strings.

The current version of this server will no longer be used by future versions of the Linkora app. Check out the `v2` branch for the next version of this server. Translation contributions will no longer be collected via Crowdin, but will be managed directly in this repository.

This version is still operable on Linkora app versions <= 0.10.0. Soon, this version will be removed and will break the app's translations. For now, everything should still work fine.

Thank you to all the translators for taking the time and adding valuable translations (yk i really appreciate it 😺🤝).
